# etrade-api
Sample code for interacting with the Etrade API

* The Python and Java examples are downloaded from
[https://developer.etrade.com/](https://developer.etrade.com/home).

* The JavaScript example is borrowed from [Ryne on
Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63662058/how-to-sign-oauth-signature-for-request-token-with-etrade-api).

* The Golang example is written by me (TODO: figure out why `access_token` fails)
